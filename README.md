# ⚓ Jinay Shah | Jynx Learning in Public

Hey, I’m Jinay — currently on a 700-day challenge to build serious depth in:

- **Cybersecurity**
- **Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)**
- **Quantum Computing / Cryptography**

I’m not chasing eye-balls or attention. I’m building foundations.  
Daily labs, real-world problems, raw notes — all shared as they happen.
