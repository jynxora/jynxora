Hey, I’m Jinay — currently on a 700-day challenge to build serious depth in:

- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity**
- 🧪 **Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)**
- ⚛️ **Quantum Computing / Cryptography**

I’m not chasing eye-balls or attention. I’m building foundations.  
Daily labs, real-world problems, raw notes — all shared as they happen.
