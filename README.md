# Jinay Shah | Jynx Learning in Public

I’m Jinay Shah.
Currently executing a 700-day skill accumulation challenge focused on building real, uncomfortable depth in:

 - Cybersecurity

 - Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)

 - Malware & Low-Level Systems

 - Quantum Computing / Cryptography

This is not content creation.
This is daily execution, failure, iteration, and documentation.

I publish:

 - lab work

 - system designs

 - raw notes

 - writeups that include what failed and why

No motivation. No shortcuts. Just accumulation.

How I Work?

 - Behavior > buzzwords

 - Explainability > clever tricks

 - Constraints acknowledged explicitly

 - If something feels confusing or ego-damaging, that’s where I stay longer

“Start before you’re ready. Publish before you’re perfect.”
Not a motto — an operating rule.
